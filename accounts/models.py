#Django's models.py file is primarily used to define tables in a database. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how this works
    #Model Definition: Each model in models.py is a Python class that corresponds to a database table. The attributes of the class represent the columns of that table. For example, if you create a model named Member, it will create a table with fields like firstname and lastname in the database
    #Database Operations: When you define models, Django provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that allows you to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL. This means you can easily create, read, update, and delete records in the database through your model classes
    #Migrations: After defining or modifying models, you need to run migration commands (makemigrations and migrate). The makemigrations command generates the necessary SQL commands to create or update the tables based on your models, while the migrate command applies these changes to the actual database
#In summary, models.py serves as the blueprint for your database schema in a Django application, enabling efficient data management through well-defined models.    


# AbstractBaseUser: Describes the shape and behavior of your user.
# BaseUserManager: Controls how users are created and saved.
# They work together: The BaseUserManager uses the blueprint defined by AbstractBaseUser to manage the user lifecycle.

# Importing necessary Django modules for creating models and user management.
